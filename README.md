# Identifying-political-connections-machine-learning

This readme contains the description of the code necessary to generate all figures and tables in the paper "Identifying Politically Connected Firms: A Machine Learning Approach" by Titl, V., Mazrekaj, D. & F. Schiltz.

The data used in this paper can be obtained from ORBIS database and public sources as described in the paper. For details, please contact the corresponding author Vita Titl (v.titl@uu.nl).

The two key files are estimation_accuracy_cv.R and graphs_cv.R. The former one runs all the models presented in the paper for training sample sized from 100 to 10,000 and saves the results (i.e. accuracies, sensitivities and so on). The latter then loads these results and plots them.
